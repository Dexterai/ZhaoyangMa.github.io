Subsequently, I worked as a full-time game developer at [PIXEL SOFT](https://www.pixelgame.net/pixelsoft/english/) (a game company), where greatly enhanced my coding power, especially in C++(It's always not very easy for someone who major in math) and Python.

research interests :
======
1.AI+, such as AI combined with Partial Differential Equations (PDEs), AI-assisted data anonymization.<br/>
2.The fundamentals of AI.<br/>
3.High-performance computing, with a particular focus on parallel computing.<br/>
