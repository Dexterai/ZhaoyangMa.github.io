踏上取经路，比抵达灵山更重要
===========

I am looking for a Ph.D. or research intern position (working as a research intern is for the PhD program, and I'm open to a volunteer onsite intern or remote intern).

I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Mathematics at [Tianjin University](https://www.tju.edu.cn/). Subsequently, I worked as a full-time game developer at [PIXEL SOFT](https://www.pixelgame.net/pixelsoft/english/) (a game company), where greatly enhanced my coding power, especially in C++(It's always not very easy for someone who major in math) and Python.

research interests :
======
1.AI for Sciences, espically ai for math (e.g., PDE).<br/>
2.The theoretical foundation of LLMs (Large language models).<br/>
3.High-performance computing,Parallel computing (e.g. multicore, SIMD, and GPU acceleration<)br/>
